# RabbitMQ - Advanced concepts

If you've reached this exercise, this means you're strong 💪 as a rock and we can throw big data at you!

To explore further queues patterns, the [RabbitMQ 🐇 tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html) are a must-do.

## Work on the tutorials

Start a RabbitMQ management instance in a `docker-compose.yml` file, expose the AMQP ports, and follow the tutorials in your preffered programming language.

## Cloud based versions

Look for cloud-based equivalent services for each of the messaging patterns.

- For instance, if you're on GCP, what does PubSub equate to?
- How would you implement topic based routing?

**Have fun!**
