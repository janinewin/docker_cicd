# Dask on K8s

🎯 Now the goal is to distribute computation across multiple machines by leveraging **dask** with **k8s**.

Dask is a parallel computing library in Python that enables distributed computing and is designed to integrate seamlessly with NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. It allows you to scale from a single machine to a cluster.

We will be able to process over **1,000,000,000** cells of new york taxi data in around **10 seconds** 💪

- That would never fit in your personal machine RAM memory 🤯
- That would take ages on your personal machine CPU 🤯

## 1️⃣ Cluster setup!

Lets start by creating a cluster with a lot of **cpus** ideal for distributing our task across!

🚨 **Cost alert** 🚨
> This will create **4 machines** (of `e2-standard-2`): 2 nodes in each of the 2 node-locations

- VM cost: 4 * $0.134/hour
- GKE overhead: $0.1/hour
- Total = $0.904/hour
- est. total for challenge ~ $1

👇 Run to create our **cluster**

```bash
gcloud container clusters create mydaskcluster \
--machine-type e2-standard-2 \
--num-nodes 2 \
--disk-size "30" \
--zone=europe-west1-b \
--node-locations=europe-west1-b,europe-west1-c
```

```bash
# TO DELETE IT LATER ON
gcloud container clusters delete mydaskcluster --zone=europe-west1-b
```

⏰ Keep reading while its provisionning (it can take 10min)

## 2️⃣ Adding our helm chart

First, install helm on your VM:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

We can install the **helm** chart on the cluster by first adding the repo.

```bash
helm repo add dask https://helm.dask.org/
helm repo update
```

❓**Checkout `config.yaml` which will be used by helm**

We are telling the cluster what the **worker** pods need in terms of **resources**. Adding the extra pip packages. ❗️ It is super important that the versions of packages you need for your code are the same locally and on the **pods** to allow it to be distributed. Finally we are disabling jupyter we are going to use the **jupyter on your vm!**

</details>

⏰ Hopefully the **GKE cluster** is done provisioning by now!

Kubectl should be now configured to apply your commands to this GKE cluster

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

Checkout the nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```


Then apply the help chart 👇

```bash
helm install mydask dask/dask -f config.yaml --version=2022.11.0
```

❓ Checkout the pods created!

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
kubectl get pods
kubectl top nodes # how cool is that 😎
```

☝️ You can see we have 6 pods running for Dask, with 3 CPU each. That's 18 CPUs for you to distribute your work on! One scheduler-pod is also using a CPU.

We've got 5 spare CPU that we're not using 🥲. Finetuning the cluster is too much work for today, let's move on!

Then you can **port forward** from port **80** (the Dask default) on the `mydask-scheduler` **service** to **8000** on your vm.

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>💡 Port forwarding reminder!</summary>

```bash
kubectl port-forward services/mydask-scheduler 8000:80
```

</details>

This lets us access the dashboard which will allow us to track the computations across our **cluster!**

## 3️⃣ Notebook time 📚

❓ **Open up `dask.ipynb` with `jupyter` (not vscode) and follow the notebook!**

Some jupyter dask extensions doesn't run in VScode

## 4️⃣ Taking it further 🕵️

❓ If you have **time** you can change `config.yaml` and delete the part disabling jupyter! Then `helm upgrade` and connect to jupyter on the cluster and dask provides some great notebooks to further your knowledge!

## 🏁 Delete your cluster 🚨

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete mydaskcluster --zone=europe-west1-b
````
