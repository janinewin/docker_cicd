## Spark warmup

This exercise are meant to be a warmup to learning pyspark syntax and the rest of the day will mostly explore other scaling up techniques. Tomorrow will involve a more in depth exercise with pyspark building an entire end to end pipeline!

## Data

We will use kaggle again this time  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

```
kaggle datasets download -d olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce --unzip -p ./data
```

Make sure to keep the kaggle page open to understand the data!
