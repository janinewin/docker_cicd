## Goals

There are several options during this recap
- Either go through the correction of the exercises
- Go through the optimisation of DBT processes
  - Setting up variables
  - Building macros
  - Building incremental models
- Showing what true `production` and `dev` environment look like in BigQuery
- Go through the BigQuery cost optimization + cost tracking in BigQuery itself
