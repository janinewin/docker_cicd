## Goal üéØ

For this last exercise, no coding is involved. We've been very hands on for the last 3 units and seen a lot of new tools and concepts.
Now let's actually take a step back and lay down the architecture of the systems we've covered in the last two units.

This exercise aims at helping you conceptualize a system before you implement it and see how all the blocks are fitting together in a production-level stack. üöÄ

## Task 1: Architecture Unit 1

Using the following website [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), create an architecture diagram of the track long project for the Unit 1.

The goal here is to give an accurate picture of the system in a single concise diagram.

- Create all the building blocks of the project
- Define with arrows the data flow between each block
- Highlight how the data is injected
- Highlight what is running in docker containers/networks
- Highlight where incoming internet traffic is hitting your stack

## Task 2: Architecture Unit 2

Now let's summarize using one or multiple diagrams the architecture of the Unit 2 learnings.

You can reuse the previous diagram and add a tab at the bottom of the page for this task or make a new one.

- Create all the building blocks of the project
- Define with arrows the data flow between each block
- Highlight how the data is injected
- Highlight what is running in docker containers/networks
- Highlight where incoming internet traffic is hitting your stack

So much ground covered in such a short time - you should be **proud of yourself**! üèÜ
