# Architecture

For this last exercise, no coding is involved. We've been very hands on for the last 2 weeks and seen a lot of notions.
Now let's actually take a step back and lay down the architecture of the 2 long track projects you've been doing in week 1 and week 2.

This exercise aims at helping you conceptualize a system before you implement it and see how all the blocks are fitting together in a complex stack.

## Task 1: Architecture track long week 1 

Using the following website [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), create an architecture diagram of the track long project for the week 1.

The goal here is to give an accurate picture of the system in a single consise diagram.

- Create all the building blocks of the project
- Define with arrows the data flow between each block
- Highlight how the data is injected
- Highlight what is running in docker containers/networks
- Highlight where incoming internet traffic is hitting your stack

## Task 2: Architecture track long week 2

Now let's summarize using one or multiple diagrams the architecture of the week 2 track long  project. 

You can reuse the previous diagram and add a tab at the bottom of the page for this task

- Create all the building blocks of the project
- Define with arrows the data flow between each block
- Highlight how the data is injected
- Highlight what is running in docker containers/networks
- Highlight where incoming internet traffic is hitting your stack
