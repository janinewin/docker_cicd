    Each plot description is vectorized using the `create_vectorized_representation` function.
    The DataFrame columns are renamed to more descriptive names, and the data is uploaded to a table named 'movies'
    in a PostgreSQL database. Existing data in the 'movies' table is preserved, and new data is appended.

    Parameters:
