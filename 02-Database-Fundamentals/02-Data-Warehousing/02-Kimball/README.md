# Kimball

We have our raw dataset it is time to follow the kimball approach

## Designing the mart


### Initial Request: Comprehensive Sales Analysis

**Business Stakeholder**: "We need a nuanced understanding of our sales metrics. Specifically, we want to know:
- Sales performance by group and by quarter.
- The impact of special offers on sales."

You now need to answer the following questions:

‚ùì Design Question: What are the key metrics and dimensions for this request?
‚ùì Design Question: What is the grain of the data mart?
‚ùì Design Question: What is the best way to model the data mart?

These types of questions are hard to answer alone discuss with your teammates and come up with a solution.

**Data Engineer's Action**: To tackle this request, you decide to create a sales-focused data mart. You identify the following dimension tables: `TerritoryDim`, `SpecialOfferDim, and `DateDim`. Your central fact table is `Fact_Sales`, which holds the key metrics like `SalesAmount`, `Quantity`, and foreign keys to dimension tables for a first fact table we normally want to go the finest grain possible to item by item

**Build the tables**

‚ùì Build the  fact and dimension tables in a new dataset called sales_mart


**Build the queries**

‚ùì Write a query to get the highest performing special offer in terms of sales amount

‚ùì Write a query to get to get the best performing groups ordered by sales

### Follow up requests

We find ourselves making lots of queries at a granularity of territory per month and we want to optimize our queries therefore we decide to create a new table that will be a snapshot of the sales per month and territory.

‚ùì Create a new fact table called `MonthlySalesSnapshotFact` that will be a snapshot of the sales per month and territory.

Why do we do this?

In the Kimball methodology for data warehousing, creating specialized fact tables like `MonthlySalesSnapshotFact` serves several purposes:

1. **Performance**: Aggregating data at the month and territory level allows for quicker query performance, reducing the need for on-the-fly aggregation of large datasets.

2. **Simplicity for End Users**: A pre-aggregated table at the monthly level makes it easier for business analysts to write queries without needing to group data themselves.

3. **Focused Metrics**: Creating a table that focuses on specific metrics (e.g., `MonthlySalesAmount` and `MonthlyQuantitySold`) simplifies the data model and makes it more understandable.

4. **Different Granularity**: The original `SalesOrderItemFact` table likely has a finer granularity (e.g., down to the individual order or item). A monthly snapshot table provides a different, coarser level of granularity useful for trend analysis.

5. **Data Consistency**: Pre-aggregated tables help ensure that everyone in the organization is working from the same numbers, reducing discrepancies that can arise from individual ad-hoc queries.

6. **Optimized Storage**: Storing pre-aggregated data can also optimize storage costs and computational resources, as you're storing fewer rows with just the metrics you need for specific types of analysis.

7. **Complex Queries**: Some types of analysis may require joining multiple tables or performing complex calculations. Having a pre-aggregated table can simplify these operations, making it easier to create reports and dashboards.

8. **Flexibility**: You can easily extend this table to include additional metrics or dimensions as the business requirements evolve, without affecting the existing data warehouse schema.

By creating a specialized table like `MonthlySalesSnapshotFact`, you align well with the Kimball methodology's focus on meeting specific business needs through tailored data structures.

### Optional

Instead of setting up a star schema you could attempt to model the data using a snowflake schema. This is a more complex schema but it can be more flexible and easier to maintain. If you want to go even further you could try to add another business unit and build a galaxy schema. The best way to understand data warehousing is to take the time to build one yourself don't be afraid to make mistakes.
