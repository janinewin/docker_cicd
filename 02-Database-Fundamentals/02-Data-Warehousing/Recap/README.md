This is a really large topic, so it is worth discussing the completed mart with the class!

## What's next?

Discuss how you would model another dataset, either another business unit of AdventureWorks or another dataset entirely. A dataset such as olist https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce would be a good choice.

Discuss the problems with slowly changing dimensions https://www.kimballgroup.com/2008/08/slowly-changing-dimensions/
