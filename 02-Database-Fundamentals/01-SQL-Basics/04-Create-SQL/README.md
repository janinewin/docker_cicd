## Create sql

🎯 This is an advanced optional exercise. It is not required for a data engineer to have such in depth knowledge but it is interesting and can help in some scenarios!

The ability to create tables is already implemented in `lwsql`

❓Your job is to create the ability to insert data and select data being able to restrict it to only some columns. You have pytest to help you. The part to deal with the disk operations is already created in `btree.py`. You will need to checkout https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html in order to understand how to process sql statements good luck!
