# Apache Beam - Programming guide

Done with all previous exercises? Well done 👏!

## Beam theory

To improve on Beam programming concepts, pick your programming language of choice (as of July 2022, Python, Java and Go are available) and following the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#overview).

## Beam in practice with Dataflow (Google Cloud only)

Now that you are familiar with the Beam programming model, you can apply your skills to the Google Cloud World.

The [Apache Beam Mobile Gaming Pipeline Examples](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/mobile-gaming-example/#hourlyteamscore-advanced-processing-in-batch-with-windowing) walks you through a more advanced tutorial than the word count example where you will:

- Load game data 🎮 from CSVs in Google Storage
- Build an hourly team score update
- Add a near-real-time leaderboard
- And finally detect abuse from the gamers 🎲

These examples give you real-world use case for Beam pipelines, if you've reached this point, you're ready for production 🎯!
