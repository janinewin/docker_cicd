# Big data - Live code

Break down an application with 2 endpoints

- one with a lot of traffic
- one with a lot less traffic

by decoupling the monolith into two separate applications, allocating different resources to each application using CloudRun.

We'll do an overview of the GCP services that can be useful when scaling up.

- Cloud CDN
- Kubernetes
- Functions
- API Gateway
- Load balancing

We can use resources like this [AWS article, Break a Monolith Application into Microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/module-four/).
