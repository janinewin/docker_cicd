# Asynchronous programming

As seen today, queues allow our programs to talk asynchronously to one another. Between them, brokers sit and allow our programs to talk to one another through messaging.

While Python is fundamentally synchronous by design, Python 3.4 and later bring a lot of ways to program asynchronously.

## Event loop

- Introduce the concept of an event loop
- The `async` / `await` pattern

## First Python `async` program

- Let's write one Python program that downloads 100 files.
- Make it faster by making it asynchronous
