# Streamlit üìà

## Set-up
In this exercise we'll first setup a simple PostgreSQL, Adminer, [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) stack using **docker compose**. The new tool we are introducing, Streamlit is a convenient python solution to create a simple UI to showcase data from various sources. It can be used to present data into custom dashboards, or to create a python web app.

### End Goal üèÅ
By the end of the setup you should:
- Have a working stack using docker-compose (PostgreSQL, Adminer, Streamlit)
- Have The Formula 1 database loaded into PostgreSQL
- Be able to check out [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### Instructions üìî
1. As usual, run the `make install` at the root directory of this day if you haven't done so. This will add all the necessary dependencies and download the necessary content for the day.

2. In the `docker-compose-basic` file - Create the database service:
- based on PostgreSQL 14
- with a Restart policy: `Always`
- Loading the database f1db.sql located in `database/init/f1db.sql` into PostgreSQL leveraging volumes and the image's entrypoint `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`
- with the Environment variables:
```yaml
- POSTGRES_DB=f1db
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
- POSTGRES_USER=postgres
```

4. Create the Adminer service
- Open the port 8080
- with a Restart policy: `Always`
- Depending on the database service

5. Create the Streamlit service
- Building the image located at the root folder
- with a Restart policy: `Always`
- Mounting the root folder into `/app/`
- Mounting the `./.streamlit` folder into `/app/.streamlit/`
- Opening the port 8501
- Depending on the database service

6. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-basic.yml up `
7. Run the sql script of `01-Streamlit/database/init/f1db.sql` to load the tables
into the Postgres database through the Adminer interface.
8. Head to http://localhost:8501 üëâ to see the dashboard‚ú®


### Connecting Streamlit to the database üîó
Before we can build our Streamlit app, we need to add a **secrets file** for Streamlit to store our credentials in. We need this to connect to the database. Secrets files are never committed to Git and should always be private or very well secured. The secret file for Streamlit is a simple `.toml` file that Streamlit automatically loads and parses at run time if in the correct location. Simply put, it is equivalent to an `.env` file.

1. In the `.streamlit` folder there is an existing config file responsible for the configuration of a few key elements in Streamlit. In the same folder add a `secrets.toml` file

2. In the `secrets.toml` file add the required credentials to connect to the PostgresSQL instance
    ```toml
    [postgres]

    drivername = "postgresql"
    host = "database"
    port = 5432
    database = "f1db"
    username = "postgres"
    password = "postgres"
    ```
You are now ready to continue with the UI implementation.

## Data üìã
We are going to use real Formula 1 data. The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with the basic functionality of Streamlit, while exploring the Formula 1 dataset.

## Streamlit basics üòé
Use the [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) of Streamlit to help you.

In the `app` folder there is a file called `basic.py`. It is already
partly filled with code, but your goal is to enhance the main Streamlit page
with the following:
- Add the right caching decorator to the `load_data` function
- Create a Streamlit title and subheader on the main page. Do the same in the sidebar
- Do some summary statistics on the data using the `describe()` method from the `Pandas` package
- Create a bar chart that shows the number of points for the 5 best-performing drivers in descending order (show the driver with the most points on the left side of the graph)
- Create a line chart with the number of points for the driver **Lewis Hamilton** over the years
- The data that is loaded needs to be stored into the session state for it
to be reusable across different pages in Streamlit, implement that functionality

**Commit and push** your code when you are finished.‚ú®

## Streamlit advanced üò±
- Copy and paste the contents of `docker-compose-basic.yml` to `docker-compose-advanced.yml`, but change the Streamlit file
that you run from `command: ["streamlit", "run", "app/basic.py"]` to `command: ["streamlit", "run", "app/advanced.py"]`.
- Convert your basic application into a multi-page app. See the Streamlit documentation
for more info on how this works. Create one file for doing descriptive
statistics, and another one for visualizing the data. Also separate the code that you created in `basic.py` into different files. Use the following structure:
  - `advanced.py` - The code with your Streamlit commands on the main page
  - `pages/01_descriptives.py` - Descriptive statistics of your data sources
  - `pages/02_visualizations.py` - Your data visualizations on a separate page
  - `advanced/cache.py` - your code for caching
  - `advanced/constants.py` - the constants that you use in your code
  - `advanced/database.py` - for initializing the database connection
  - `advanced/queries.py` - your queries for retrieving the data
  - `advanced/transforms.py` - any additional Python data transformations if needed


## Storytelling üì¢
Now that the engineering structure is in place, it is time to further explore the data.

You all assigned to a Formula 1 team in pairs. It is your job to give a presentation to the management of your team on how well you think your team will do in 2019 based on the data of the previous years. Furthermore, the CTO is interested in knowing about the technical details of your Streamlit application, so you need to create an extra page where you explain how you ensure that your web app stays fast, even if the amount of data would increase. Some questions that you could answer:
- How many points has your team scored over the years?
- Who are your current drivers?
- If a driver is not performing well, which drivers should your team consider getting from another team?
- What has historically been the best racetrack for your team?
- What has been the worst racetrack?
- Which 2 teams are your closest competitors?


Use your creativity to come up with some more analysis if you have the time. Support your analysis using Streamlit titles and text using **Markdown**. `At the end of this day we will ask you to present your findings to the group.` Use your Streamlit application for your presentation. There is **no need** to create any slides.
