### Answers

In this assignment, you will be presented with six scenarios that describe different types of data storage and retrieval needs. Your task is to choose a database for each scenario and explain your choice. The included options are: Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases, Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases, key-value stores, document databases, graph databases, and columnar databases.

Here are the scenarios:

1. A company has a large dataset of customer information, including names, addresses, and purchase histories. They need to be able to quickly retrieve individual customer records and perform analysis on the data to gain insights into spending trends.

Recommended database: OLAP

Explanation: An OLAP database is designed for fast querying and analysis of large datasets, making it well-suited for this scenario.

2. A social media platform needs to store and retrieve large amounts of user-generated content, including text posts, images, and videos. The system needs to be able to handle a high volume of read and write operations.

Recommended database: OLTP

Explanation: An OLTP database is optimized for high-speed read and write operations and is able to handle a high volume of transactions, making it well-suited for this scenario.

3. A financial institution needs to store and process large amounts of financial transaction data. The system needs to be able to support complex queries and calculations, and handle a high volume of read and write operations.

Recommended database: OLTP + OLAP

Explanation: an OLTP database would be the most appropriate choice for storing and processing the transactional data. An OLAP database could be used in addition to the OLTP database to support fast querying and analysis of the data. This way, the OLTP database can handle the high volume of read and write operations without interference, while the OLAP database can be used for more complex queries and analysis without impacting the performance of the transactional system.

4. A software application needs to store and retrieve data about users and their connections. The data is highly interconnected, with many relationships between different types of entities.

Recommended database: Graph

Explanation: A graph database is designed to store and retrieve data with complex relationships and connections, making it well-suited for this scenario.

---

5. A retail company needs to store and retrieve information about products, including descriptions, prices, and inventory levels. The system needs to be able to handle a high volume of read and write operations, and support fast searches for specific products.

Recommended database: Document-database, or OLTP more generally

Explanation: A document database could be considered, as these types of databases are designed specifically for fast storage and retrieval of data related to a well-define aggregates (here, products)

---

6. A company needs to store and retrieve large amounts of structured and unstructured data, such as documents, images, and videos. The data does not need to be accessed in real-time, but it needs to be easy to search and retrieve.

Recommended database: Document

Explanation: A document database is designed to store and retrieve large amounts of structured and unstructured data and provides fast search capabilities, making it well-suited for this scenario.

---

7. A company needs to store and analyze large amounts of data that is organized into columns, such as data from a financial or scientific application. The system needs to be able to handle a high volume of read and write operations and support fast querying and analysis.

Recommended database: Columnar (such as Cassandra)

Explanation: A columnar database, such as Apache Cassandra, is designed to store and retrieve data organized into columns and is optimized for fast querying and analysis, making it well-suited for this scenario.

---

8. A company needs to store and retrieve small pieces of data, such as user preferences or session information, in real-time. The system needs to be able to handle a high volume of read and write operations and provide fast access to the data.

Recommended database: Key-value store

Explanation: A key-value store is designed to store and retrieve small pieces of data quickly and can handle a high volume of read and write operations, making it well-suited for this scenario.
