### 🎯 Goal

In this challenge, you will focus on creating a more complex **ETL**, without caring about setting-up the docker-compose.

We'll have:
- an API to call for data as JSON
- a "lake" (`data` folder) to store raw JSON in "bronze" folder, transformed JSON in "silver" folder
- a "warehouse" (`postgres db`) to store transformed data in a structured manner.

The goal is to have a DAG running every day that will:
- (**Extract**) Downloads a Chuck Norris' joke, using this [api](https://api.chucknorris.io), saving them as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) into your "Lake"
- (**Transform**) Translates it to Swedish, saving them again in the "Lake"
- (**Load**) Inserts them it into your "Warehouse"

For sake of simplicity, in this challenge, the postgres "warehouse" will be the same postgres database than the one used by airflow as DATA metadata, and is called `db`, as per docker-compose:
- POSTGRES_DB=db
- POSTGRES_USER=airflow

We will see later in the bootcamp how to connect to an external BigQuery warehouse instead.

# 1️⃣ Setup ⚙️

The Dockerfile and docker-compose are similar to that of previous challenge, with one exception: the entrypoint.sh now contains an additional line to reference the warehouse.

```bash

airflow connections add 'postgres_connection' \
                    --conn-type postgres \
                    --conn-host "postgres" \
                    --conn-schema "$POSTGRES_DB" \
                    --conn-login "$POSTGRES_USER" \
                    --conn-password "$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" \
                    --conn-port "5432"
```

👉 Adding such connections is required to interact the warehouse explicitly in our **load**  stage:

```python
PostgresOperator(
    sql=... # create warehouse table, insert translated jokes...
    postgres_conn_id='postgres_connection')
```

💡 We didn't need it in our previous challenge as we were not storing anything in a warehouse!

You just have to add your `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in a new `.env` file, then:

```
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to:
- access airflow webserver on `localhost:8080`
- access airflow db via DBeaver on port `localhost:5433`

# 2️⃣ DAG Instructions ↪

First, let's focus on creating the proper DAG configuration (no tasks or python functions needed for now).

You need to create a DAG with the following requirements:
- it should be named `local_etl`
- it should be scheduled to run every day, with a start date equal to five days ago (so we'll simulate 5 runs)
- it should have a description saying `A local etl`
- it should catchup the missing runs
- it should run only if the previous runs succeed

🧪 Once, you are confident with your code run:

```bash
make test_dag_config
```

## Tasks 🏋️

Then, we want you to create the tasks that your DAG will use. This time you will create more tasks that will do less things.

You need four tasks:

### a) A `create_swedified_jokes_table` task_id
- as a [PostgresOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-postgres/stable/_api/airflow/providers/postgres/operators/postgres/index.html#module-airflow.providers.postgres.operators.postgres) :
- that should create a table named `swedified_jokes` with 3 columns:
- `id` (serial primary)
- `joke` (varchar not null)
- `swedified_joke` (varchar not null)

### b) `extract` task_id
- as a [BashOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/bash.html):
- that [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) a random Chuck Norris' joke from [https://api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io).
- The joke should be saved to the bronze folder under the name `joke_{execution_date}.json` where {execution_date} corresponds to the execution date of the Airflow dag (for instance: */app/airflow/data/bronze/joke_20220521.json*). 💡 Check [airflow template variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/templates-ref.html)

### c) `transform` task_id
- as a [PythonOperator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.0/howto/operator/python.html)
- that should trigger the `transform` function with the proper arguments (don't fill the python function yet)
- The transformed joke should be saved to the silver folder under the name joke_{execution_date}.json (for instance: */app/airflow/data/silver/joke_20220521.json*).


### d) `load` task_id
- as a `PythonOperator`
- that should trigger the `load` function with the proper arguments (don't fill python function yet)

### Now, arrange your tasks
- The second task should be triggered only after the first one's success.
- The third task should be triggered only after the second one's success.
- The fourth task should be triggered only after the third one's success.

🧪 Once you are confident with your code run:
```bash
make test_tasks_configs
```

Once you passed the tests, launch your Airflow instance and open [localhost](http://localhost:8080/home) to see how your DAG looks.

You should see your four tasks. Turn the DAG on and see what happens! It should be all green 🟢 as your tasks called functions that do not do anything for now.

## Python Functions 🐍

To help you, we have already added the signature of 6 functions. This is now your turn to implement them in the current order.

🧪 Once you are confident with your code run:
```bash
make test_python_functions
```

Now, you should be able to trigger the DAG, see green results and have your `swedified_jokes` table being filled. Check it out on DBEAVER!

# 4️⃣ Airflow Pro Tips 💡

## 🐛 Debugging in Airflow ?

**Reset Airflow DB**
In case you want to replay your challenge history from scratch, you can reset your airflow metadata database as if the were never run before

```bash
docker-compose exec webserver poetry run airflow db reset
```

Otherwise, you can also `sudo rm -rf database` entirely, but that's not a great skill to master in real life ;)

**Check logs on Airflow UI**
It's our recommended approach to begin with. Below, the second task of our first run has failed. And 4 other run are planned and running (they wait for the next 4 days to be finish)
You can click on "Log" to inspect logs

<img src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/airflow_failing.png">



**Check logs from your Terminal**

You can access your logs from your terminal, but mixing logs of 3 services at once can be messy. Simply open 3 terminal, each with one of the commands:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f postgres
docker-compose logs -f scheduler
docker-compose logs -f webserver
```

**Check logs from logs folder**
You should be able to see the exact same information in your `logs` folder, which is precious to grep for "ERROR" lines etc...!

## 🧪 Understand tests in Airflow (optional) ?

It can be interesting to read our tests to learn how to test your DAGs.

👉 Have a look at your `makefile`, and let's focus on `test_dag_config`

- We don't want to test your code against your "production" database `db`.
- Therefore, everytime you're running `make test_dag_config`, we're creating a local sqlite metadata db on which we will run your dags.
- How does it work?
  - We're changing AIRFLOW_HOME to a new temp folder.
  - Then run `airflow db init`, which will create a brand new airflow project which by default creates a sqlite metadata db with correct schema migrations.
- You can inspect the 3 files that were created inside `tests/temp`
  - `airflow.db` is the sqlite copy of you postgresdb. You can peer inside with VSCode SQLlite extension: you should see some sweedified jokes inside it!
  - `webserver_config.py`
  - `airflow.cfg`
    - check line 185: your `sql_alchemy_conn` refers to that local sqlite!
    - compare it to that of your currently running app: `docker-compose exec webserver poetry run airflow config get-value database sql_alchemy_conn`
- Open our `test_tasks_config.py`
  - line 18 we're using a DagBag to "parse" your dags from your local folder `./dags`. We'll then be able to tests your dag syntax without actually running anything (ex. line 39)
  - Then we also want to make fake "runs" of you dag against the temporary sqlite. For that, we first have to redirect the postgres connection by loading another `tests/scripts/init_connections.sh` from Makefile context. This allows us to override the Postgres hook on your DAB by a SqliteHook in our test (line 19). We can then `hook.run(...)` anything we want and launch your dag via `dag.create_dagrun(...)`. The process of replacing a variable by another one of same name at test time is called "mocking".


# 🏁 Congratulation!

Run `make test` to create test_output.txt, then git add, commit and push your code so we can track your progress!
