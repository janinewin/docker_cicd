# Minikube & Kubectl 101

In this challenge, we will learn how to deploy our first application with **Kubernetes** and **Minikube**.

Minikube allows developers to run Kubernetes **locally** on their machine, as it was a cluster of nodes.
It is an excellent tool to **help developers and new Kubernetes users in deploying applications with K8s**.

Under the hood, minikube creates a virtual machine in your container in which there is single cluster of one node.


To use Minikube, as mentioned in the [documentation](<https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>), you'll need:

- **2 CPUs** or more
- **2GB of RAM**
- **20GB** of free disk space
- **Container or virtual machine manager** such as: Docker, Hyperkit, Podman, etc.

In our case, we will use Docker to launch Minikube. Please launch Docker on your machine.

## Minikube and Kubectl Installation - skip if already done.

Please start by enabling Kubernetes on Docker Destop. Go over Docker Desktop, click on Settings, then Kubernetes and click on **Enable Kubernetes**.
ðŸš¨ Please follow the instruction [here](<https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>) to install Minikube.

## Launching Minikube

To launch minikube and start a cluster, you'll need to open a terminal and run the following command :

```bash
minikube start
```


Please wait minikube to start, it can take up to a few minutes.


Once started, you can interact with your cluster thanks to `kubectl`, just likfe for any other K8s cluster.

For instance, you can inspect your cluster node.
```bash
kubectl get node
```

You should see something like

```txt
NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane,master   75s   v1.23.3
```

## First tips - Sharing your Docker daemon

When you work with minikube, you work within a VM with its own docker daemon.

In order to let our local Docker daemon to communicate with minikube's Docker daemon, we need to run the following command:

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

This command specifies to the docker client to use the docker service running inside the minikube virtual machine.
Now any â€˜dockerâ€™ command you run in this current terminal will run against the docker inside minikube cluster.


Now we can â€˜buildâ€™ against the docker inside minikube, which is instantly accessible to Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
docker build -t app .
```

*Alternatively, there is one other effective way to push your local Docker image directly to Minikube, which could save time from building the images in minikube again: `minikube image load <image_name>`*

## Our first K8s service

Let's create our first service on Kubernetes.
A service is an **abstraction** that defines a set of **Pods** running in your cluster, and a **policy** by which to reach them Sometimes this pattern is called a **micro-service**.

When created, the Service is assigned a unique IP address.
This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive.

Pods can be configured to talk to the Service, and know that communication to the Service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is part of the Service.

These Pods are exposed through endpoints. When a Pod dies, it is automatically removed from the endpoints, and new Pods matching the Service's selector will automatically get added to the endpoints.


```bash
touch service.yaml
```

```yaml
#service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: flask-service

spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000
      targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: flask

```

In the first part, we specify that the configuration file is for a Service that we named `flask-service`.

A selector usually determines the set of Pods targeted by a Service.
In the spec, we specify that it is a **LoadBalancer service**.
This specification creates a new Service object named "flask-service", which targets TCP port 8000 on any Pod with the flask label.

We then expose it on an abstracted Service port 5000.

`targetPort`: is the port the container accepts traffic on.
`port`: is the abstracted Service port, which can be any port other pods use to access the Service.



Let's create our service

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
You should see `service/flask-service created`

Let's inspect our new service

```bash
kubectl get service flask-service
```

You should see something like this

```text
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
flask-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.231.152   <pending>     8000:30604/TCP   24s
```


## Our first K8s Deployment

Within Kubernetes, a container runs in a pod, which can be represented as one instance of a running service.
Pods are ephemeral and not self-healing, which makes them fragile.
They can go down when an interruption occurs on the server, during a brief network problem, or due to a minimal memory issueâ€”and it can bring down your entire application with it. Kubernetes deployments help to prevent this downtime.
In a deployment, you can describe the desired state for your application and Kubernetes will constantly check if this state is matched.
A deployment will create ReplicaSets which then ensures that the desired number of pods are running.
If a pod goes down due to an interruption, the ReplicaSets controller will notice that the desired state does not match the actual state, and a new pod will be created.

Deployments offer:

- High availability of your application (pods) by creating a ReplicaSets
- (Auto)scaling of pods
- Multiple strategies to deploy your application
- The possibility to rollback to an earlier revision of your deployment

Let's now run our Deployment. A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive.

```bash
touch deployment.yaml
```

```yaml
#deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: flask-deployment

spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-container
        image: app:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
```

In the first part of the configuration, we specify that the configuration we are applying is for a Deployment resource that we call flask-deployment.

In the spec, we specify the number of replicas, here 4.
It means that we will always have 4 pods running our application flask.
This pods will each run a container app that we have build previously and renamed flask-container here.

We then specify the port exposed in the container 5000.

By Default, a Deployment will always try to pull the image from a remote registery. If you want to use a local image to build a container in the pods, you need to specify the imagePullPolicy to Never.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
you should see `deployment.apps/flask-deployment created`


Let's inspect our 4 pods created
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
You should see 4 pods running
```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flask-deployment-746c85b46f-2sdp2   1/1     Running   0          26s
flask-deployment-746c85b46f-dqcxs   1/1     Running   0          26s
flask-deployment-746c85b46f-h5vls   1/1     Running   0          26s
flask-deployment-746c85b46f-rgm82   1/1     Running   0          26s
```

If you want to launch the app, just hit

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

And boom, your app here is deployed:
<http://localhost:8000/>

## Using Minikube dashboard

Minikube has an excellent UI interface to manage and visualize your clusters.
You can use it to :

- get an overview of applications running on the K8s cluster
- deploy containerized applications to a K8s cluster
- debug your containerized application
- manage cluster resources and create or change individual resources

[](https://www.grammarly.com/signin)To launch minikube dashboard, let's open a new terminal and run:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

## Stopping minikube

To delete your local cluster

```bash
minikube delete
```


To stop minikube

```bash
minikube stop
```
