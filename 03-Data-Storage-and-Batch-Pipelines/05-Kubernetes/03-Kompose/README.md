There are lots of tools to help speed up our writing of k8s but kompose takes this one step further automatically generating k8s from docker compose files! 🤯

In this challenge we are going to take a **style transfer app** which applies a chosen style to a given image. Then use kompose to generate our k8s for us from docker-compose. Now we know how to move to GKE for the remaining exercises we are going to stay on minikube for time and money!


## 1️⃣ Test your app locally 💻

First try the app with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can checkout 🕵️‍♂️ the code the images are built from in the `backend` and `frontend` folders.

Then start a new minikube cluster

```bash
minikube delete
minikube start
```

We are ready to go!

## 2️⃣ Kompose 🎼


```bash
kompose convert -f docker-compose.yaml
```

We get few warnings

<img src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-engineering/W1D5/kompose-first-attempt.png">

- The first warning is important as our backend won't have a `service` created. A `deployment` does not necessarily need a `service`, but when our pods will want to connect with each other it will makes our life much easier.
- The second warning is about our "bind mount": kompose cannot translate that automatically, it can only deal with managed "docker volumes".

❓ **Try to rectify both of these problems!**

You can either fix it by fixing the k8s files yourself (longer) or you can change the docker-compose.yaml, so that backend has a port and both use a docker-managed volume that kompose can interpret more easily.

    volumes:
      - style-storage:/storage

Once you have fixed the issues, apply your new files with `kubectl apply -f .`

🤯 If you have written good `docker-compose` files its as easy as just `kompose convert -f docker-compose.yml && kubectl apply -f .` but generally it is recommended to check the translation before applying it to your cluster.


❓ Finally access the `frontend` service and verify that it works the same as when we just did `docker-compose up`.

🏁 In the next exercise we are going to see how we can bring both the frontend and backend together in a single pod!
